                <h3 class="mb-3">Check if accounts.google.com cookies are blocked</h3>
                <p>Recent Chrome releases (all platforms) and Safari on macOS block or remove cookies used on third-party sites youâ€™ve not visited directly.
                    To sign into MindMup using Google, your browser needs to allow cookies from <strong>accounts.google.com</strong>.</p>
                <p>This is a service domain which you most likely never visited directly, so those cookies might be blocked.</p>
                <p>Try adding this domain to the white-list for your browser, or unblocking third-party cookies temporarily.</p>
                <p>Here are the instructions for <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647">Chrome</a>, <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/safari/manage-cookies-and-website-data-sfri11471/mac">Safari</a> and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enable-and-disable-cookies-website-preferences">Firefox</a>.</p>

            <h3 class="mb-3">Are you using disconnect, ghostery, privacy badger or some other blocker extension?</h3>
            <p>Those modules, by design, block requests going out of a web site, so they will block access to Google Authentication and Google Drive from MindMup.</p>
            <p>In order to use Google Services via MindMup, you will need to whitelist those requests or domains. Check your privacy module documentation about that.</p>

            <h3 class="mb-3">Are you using an ad blocker?</h3>
            <p>Some misconfigured ad blockers may think that requests to Google services are trying to load ads.</p>
            <p>To check if you have this problem, start MindMup in a private (incognito) mode and check if it works.</p>
            <p>Here are the instructions for <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464?hl=en-GB">Chrome</a> and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/private-browsing-use-firefox-without-history">Firefox</a>.</p>
            <p>You may need to whitelist Google Drive in those ad blockers to allow MindMup to access it.</p>
